# Machine Learning Meets Web/Software Development
NOTE: Due to the nature of this project, code cannot be shared publicly.
# Overview
This project was undertaken as part of a hackathon challenge to address the low customer retention of a movie-streaming service lacking a recommender system. The goal was to identify trends in movie watching, create an effective movie recommender system, and integrate it into an application to enhance user engagement and revenue for the platform.

# Problem Statement
The movie-streaming service faced declining customer retention due to the absence of a recommender system, a feature its competitors utilized successfully. The challenge was to create a robust movie recommender system to enhance content discovery, increase user engagement, and boost platform revenue.

# Approach

## Tools Used
Python
Streamlit
scikit-learn
nltk
Comet
GitHub
AWS EC2 with S3 bucket

# Methodology

Analyzed user behavior and preferences to identify viewing patterns.
Utilized Python libraries and machine learning techniques to create a movie recommender system.
Implemented the system into a user-friendly app using Streamlit.
Leveraged AWS EC2 with S3 bucket for data storage and seamless app deployment.

# Project Outcomes

# Findings

Identified trends in movie-watching behavior.
Discovered that top users' ratings heavily influenced the system, potentially skewing recommendations.
Observed a disparity between high and low ratings, indicating a lack of diverse user preferences data.
Challenges Faced
Limited data on user dislikes due to infrequent low ratings.
Need for encouraging users to rate movies, especially lesser-known ones, for more accurate recommendations.

# Conclusion
The project's outcome highlighted the importance of diverse user ratings and the challenge of handling skewed data from top users. The conclusions drawn emphasized the need for encouraging users to rate movies more frequently to balance the system.

# Rankings
Out of 257 participating teams, our team secured the 146th position in the hackathon challenge.

# Recommendations
Encourage users to rate movies, particularly those with few ratings and infrequent raters.
Consider users' watch time; movies with low watch times might indicate dissatisfaction.
